            I’m a <span class="text-light">MERN Stack developer</span> and <span class="text-light">Frontend
                Engineer</span> specializing in <b>web
                    accessibility</b>,
            building <b>pixel-perfect</b>, <b>responsive</b>, and <b>intuitive user interfaces</b>. I love
            working at the
            intersection of design and engineering, where exceptional user experience meets clean,
            scalable code and modern
            development practices.

            Previously, I’ve built a wide range of web applications using the <span class="text-light">MERN
                stack</span> (MongoDB,
            Express,
            React, Node.js), with a strong emphasis on <b>clean architecture</b>, <b>reusable
                components</b>, and <b>scalable frontend systems</b>. I’m experienced in <b>component-driven development</b>, <b>CI/CD workflows</b>, and maintaining design
            systems that stay
            consistent as projects grow.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="800">
            Alongside web development, I’m also an expert in <span class="text-light">Adobe
                Photoshop</span>, <span class="text-light">Premiere Pro</span>,
            and <span class="text-light">After Effects</span>,
            which allows me to
            produce high-quality <b>UI mockups</b>, <b>motion graphics</b>, and polished <b>video
                content</b> for product demos
            and marketing assets. I regularly experiment with new tools and
            frameworks to sharpen my skills and stay current with modern development
            practices.
